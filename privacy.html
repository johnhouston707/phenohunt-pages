    <h2 id="legal-bases">4) Legal Bases for Processing (EEA/UK Users)</h2>
    <p>Where GDPR/UK GDPR applies, our processing is based on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contract necessity</strong> (Art. 6(1)(b)) — to provide the Services you request</li>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong> (Art. 6(1)(a)) — for optional marketing and certain optional features</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (Art. 6(1)(f)) — to improve, secure, and analyze the Services in ways that do not override your rights</li>
      <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong> (Art. 6(1)(c)) — to meet applicable legal requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="marketing">5) Marketing Communications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We only send marketing emails/SMS with your explicit opt-in.</li>
      <li>You may unsubscribe at any time via in-message links (emails) or by replying STOP to SMS, or via <em>Account → Communication Preferences</em> in-app.</li>
      <li>We keep a record of your consent and preferences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="data-sharing">6) Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information. We share it only as described below:</p>
    <h3>6.1 Service Providers (Processors)</h3>
    <p>We use carefully selected vendors for hosting, storage, authentication, email/SMS delivery, analytics, logging, and customer support. They may access personal data solely to perform services on our behalf and are bound by confidentiality and data protection terms (DPAs). Current core provider: <strong>Supabase</strong> (database, authentication, real-time sync, and storage). We may add providers in the future and will update this Policy or our in-app provider list accordingly.</p>

    <h3>6.2 Legal Requirements and Safety</h3>
    <p>We may disclose information to comply with laws or lawful requests, to protect our rights, users, or the public, or to investigate fraud or security issues. Where legally permitted and feasible, we will notify you before disclosing your data.</p>

    <h3>6.3 Business Transfers</h3>
    <p>If we undergo a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred to the successor entity subject to this Policy.</p>

    <h3>6.4 Aggregated/De-identified Data</h3>
    <p>We may share aggregated or de-identified data that does not identify you.</p>

    <h2 id="where-stored">7) Where We Store and Process Data</h2>
    <p>We host our backend with Supabase in a project region we select. Supabase offers multiple regions. Your project is created in one of these regions and your primary database is hosted there.</p>
    <p>For file uploads (e.g., photos), Supabase Storage may serve assets using a global CDN to deliver content quickly worldwide; cached copies may be briefly stored at edge locations outside your primary region.</p>
    <p>For observability and security, we may use platform logging that can include request metadata (e.g., IP address, user agent), with retention based on plan and configuration. Authentication audit logs may record events (e.g., sign-ins, resets) for security and compliance.</p>
    <p>We maintain DPAs with our processors.</p>

    <h2 id="international">8) International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>If you are outside the United States, your information may be transferred to or accessed from the U.S. and other countries where our providers operate or cache content (e.g., CDN edge locations). Where required by law, we use appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and vendor DPAs, and we limit transfers to what is necessary to provide the Services.</p>

    <h2 id="security">9) Security</h2>
    <p>We use technical and organizational measures aligned with industry standards, including encryption in transit (TLS) and encryption of sensitive data at rest, role-based access controls, least-privilege, and audit logging where available, secure hashing of passwords, and regular updates and vulnerability management. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. If we learn of a breach impacting your information, we will notify you <strong>by email</strong> consistent with applicable law and this Policy.</p>

    <h2 id="retention">10) Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> kept while your account is active.</li>
      <li><strong>User Content:</strong> kept until you delete it or delete your account.</li>
      <li><strong>Deleted Data:</strong> removed from active systems within <strong>30 days</strong>; backup copies may persist for up to <strong>90 days</strong> (then overwritten in the ordinary course of business).</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing Preferences:</strong> updated immediately upon request.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="rights">11) Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <h3>11.1 In-App Controls</h3>
    <p>You can access, export, correct, or delete your data from <em>Account → Settings</em>. An in-app <strong>Delete Account</strong> feature is provided; deleting your account triggers deletion of associated personal data from active systems per Section 10.</p>

    <h3>11.2 Opt-Out of Marketing</h3>
    <p>Use unsubscribe links in emails, reply <span class="mono">STOP</span> to SMS, or adjust preferences in-app.</p>

    <h3>11.3 EU/EEA/UK Rights</h3>
    <p>Where GDPR/UK GDPR applies, you have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, object, and port your data, and to withdraw consent at any time (without affecting prior lawful processing). You may also lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</p>

    <h3>11.4 U.S. State Rights (CA, CO, CT, UT, VA, etc.)</h3>
    <p>Depending on your state, you may have rights to know/access, correct, delete, obtain a portable copy, and to opt-out of “sales” or “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not “sell” or “share” personal information as those terms are defined under the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). If this changes, we will update this Policy and provide a “Do Not Sell or Share” mechanism.</li>
      <li>You may use an authorized agent (CA) to submit a request, subject to verification.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Submitting Requests.</strong> Use the in-app controls or email <a href="mailto:privacy@phenohunt.com">privacy@phenohunt.com</a>. We will verify your identity (e.g., email verification) before fulfilling your request. <strong>Appeals:</strong> If we deny a request (e.g., VA), you may appeal by replying to our decision notice or emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@phenohunt.com">privacy@phenohunt.com</a>.</p>

    <h3>11.5 Do Not Track / Global Privacy Control</h3>
    <p>Our app does not respond to browser Do Not Track signals. If we implement cross-context behavioral advertising on the web in the future, we will evaluate and honor applicable Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals consistent with law.</p>

    <h2 id="children">12) Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Services are not for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under the applicable age threshold in your jurisdiction and, in any case, not from users under <strong>21</strong> for the app. If you believe a minor provided data, contact <a href="mailto:privacy@phenohunt.com">privacy@phenohunt.com</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="content">13) Additional Disclosures About Your Content</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>EXIF/GPS in Images:</strong> Uploaded photos may contain embedded metadata (e.g., EXIF, GPS coordinates). Consider removing sensitive metadata before uploading.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensitive Categories:</strong> Do not upload content you are not legally permitted to possess, store, or share. We do not review content for legal compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="third-party">14) Third-Party Sign-In and Links</h2>
    <p>If you use Google Sign-In, data we receive is governed by this Policy; Google’s processing is governed by Google’s privacy policy. Third-party sites or services linked from the app are governed by their own policies.</p>

    <h2 id="california">15) State-Specific Notice for California Residents (Notice at Collection)</h2>
